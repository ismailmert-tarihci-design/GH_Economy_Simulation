QA SECTION 5: EDGE CASE VERIFICATION
=====================================

TEST DATE: 2026-02-18

EDGE CASE 1: ZERO PACKS
-----------------------
Configuration:
- Set all pack_averages to 0.0
- num_days = 10

Results:
✅ Simulation completed without crash
✅ Days simulated: 10
✅ Total bluestars: 0 (CORRECT - expected 0 with zero packs)
✅ No errors or exceptions

Verdict: PASS

EDGE CASE 2: SINGLE DAY
-----------------------
Configuration:
- num_days = 1

Results:
✅ Simulation completed without crash
✅ Days simulated: 1 (CORRECT - single snapshot)
✅ Total bluestars: 0
✅ Coin balance: 0
✅ Valid results returned with single-day data

Verdict: PASS

EDGE CASE 3: MAX MC RUNS (500)
-------------------------------
Configuration:
- num_days = 10
- Monte Carlo runs = 500

Results:
✅ MC simulation completed without crash
✅ Runs: 500
✅ Days: 10
✅ Elapsed time: 3.97s (excellent performance)
✅ Mean bluestars: 0.00 (valid result)
✅ Warning message displayed for large run count (good UX)
✅ Performance excellent: < 4 seconds for 500 runs

Verdict: PASS

ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONS:
-----------------------
✅ All edge cases handle gracefully with no crashes
✅ Zero-value configs produce expected zero results
✅ Single-day simulations return valid single snapshots
✅ Large MC run counts complete quickly (500 runs in ~4s)
✅ User warnings displayed for large run counts
✅ No memory issues or performance degradation

OVERALL VERDICT: PASS
=====================
All edge cases verified successfully:
- Zero packs: No crash, zero bluestars (correct)
- Single day: No crash, single snapshot (correct)
- 500 MC runs: No crash, completes in 3.97s (excellent)
- No errors encountered in any edge case
