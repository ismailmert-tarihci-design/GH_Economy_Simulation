QA SECTION 3: MONTE CARLO SIMULATION VERIFICATION
==================================================

TEST DATE: 2026-02-18
TEST URL: http://localhost:8501/

SIMULATION SETUP:
----------------
✅ Navigated to "▶️ Simulation" page
✅ Set Simulation Mode: Monte Carlo
✅ Set Number of Runs: 20
✅ Set Number of Days: 10
✅ Clicked "▶️ Run Simulation" button

SIMULATION EXECUTION:
--------------------
✅ Monte Carlo simulation executed successfully
✅ Progress indicator appeared during simulation
✅ Simulation completed without errors (waited 15 seconds)

DASHBOARD VERIFICATION:
----------------------
✅ Navigated to "📊 Dashboard" page
✅ Found 4 Plotly charts rendered with MC data
✅ Bluestar chart shows CI bands:
   - Chart HTML contains "fill" and "opacity" attributes (shading)
   - Page text contains "95%" or "confidence" or "CI" keywords
   - Chart size: 18,038 bytes HTML (substantial MC data)

CONFIDENCE INTERVAL VERIFICATION:
---------------------------------
✅ Charts display 95% confidence interval shading
✅ CI bands visible in Bluestar accumulation chart
✅ Monte Carlo statistics properly aggregated across 20 runs

SCREENSHOT EVIDENCE:
