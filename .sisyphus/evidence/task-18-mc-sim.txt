QA SECTION 4: MONTE CARLO SIMULATION - 20×10 RUN
===================================================================

TEST DATE: Wed Feb 18 2026
OBJECTIVE: Run 20×10 Monte Carlo simulation, verify progress indicator and CI bands

RESULTS:

STATUS: ❌ BLOCKED - Cannot test Monte Carlo mode

REASON:
  Monte Carlo simulation depends on the same simulation engine as deterministic mode.
  The TypeError discovered in Section 3 affects ALL simulation runs:
  
  Error: '<=' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'int'
  Location: simulation/pack_system.py:43
  
  Since the core simulation engine crashes during pack processing, Monte Carlo
  mode cannot complete any runs to display progress indicators or confidence bands.

BLOCKING BUG:
  - Same root cause as Section 3 failure
  - Affects both deterministic and Monte Carlo modes
  - Located in _get_card_types_for_count() function
  - Type mismatch between card_types_table keys (strings) and total_unlocked (int)

IMPACT:
  Cannot verify:
  - Monte Carlo runs complete successfully
  - Progress indicator displays during multi-run execution
  - Confidence interval bands render on charts
  - Statistical summary displays correctly

CONCLUSION:
  BLOCKED - Monte Carlo simulation cannot be tested until pack_system.py 
  type coercion bug is fixed. This is the same blocking issue as Section 3.
