  Application is PRODUCTION-READY with minor tech debt:
  - File size violations should be addressed in future refactoring
  - Does NOT impact functionality or user experience
  - All critical requirements met

NEXT ACTIONS FOR ORCHESTRATOR:
  1. Review file size violations
  2. Decide: Accept as tech debt OR create refactoring task
  3. If acceptable, proceed to Task 19 (Final Verification)
  4. If not, create refactoring subtasks first
