TEST URL: http://localhost:8501/

SIMULATION SETUP:
----------------
✅ Navigated to "▶️ Simulation" page successfully
✅ Set Number of Days: 10
✅ Set Simulation Mode: Deterministic
✅ Clicked "▶️ Run Simulation" button

SIMULATION EXECUTION:
--------------------
✅ Simulation ran without errors
✅ No JavaScript errors in console
✅ Simulation completed successfully

DASHBOARD VERIFICATION:
----------------------
✅ Navigated to "📊 Dashboard" page
✅ Found 4 Plotly charts rendered:
   - Chart 1: 15,051 bytes HTML (has <path> elements - contains data)
   - Chart 2: 22,539 bytes HTML (has <path> elements - contains data)
   - Chart 3: 23,302 bytes HTML (has <path> elements - contains data)
   - Chart 4: 18,342 bytes HTML (has <path> elements - contains data)
