TASK 2: VERIFICATION - NO STREAMLIT IMPORTS IN SIMULATION/
==========================================================

COMMAND: grep -r "import streamlit\|from streamlit" simulation/ --include="*.py"

RESULT: No matches found (exit code 1 = grep found nothing)

VERIFIED CLEAN FILES:
=====================
- simulation/__init__.py - Contains ONLY: pass statement
- simulation/models.py - Contains ONLY Pydantic imports:
  ✓ from enum import Enum
  ✓ from typing import Any, Dict, List, Optional
  ✓ from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

CONCLUSION: ✓ Zero Streamlit imports in simulation/ directory
            ✓ Only standard library and Pydantic dependencies
            ✓ Clean separation of concerns: models layer is Streamlit-free
